    <!-- Hello World.-->
    <p></p><p style="color: ghostwhite;">Himura Kenshin (緋村 剣心) is a former legendary assassin known as "Hitokiri Battōsai" (人斬り抜刀斎)(rendered as Battousai the Manslayer in the Media Blasters English anime dub, as Battousai: The Slayer.
        [3]) At the end of the Bakumatsu, he becomes a wandering samurai, now wielding a sakabatō, a katana that has the cutting edge on the inwardly curved side of the sword, thus being nearly incapable of killing.
        Kenshin wanders the country offering protection and aid to those in need, as atonement for the killings he once committed as an assassin. In Tokyo, he meets a young woman named Kamiya Kaoru, who invites him to live in her dojo despite learning about Kenshin's past. 
        Throughout the series, Kenshin begins to establish relationships with many people, including ex-enemies, while dealing with his fair share of foes, new and old.

    <p style="color: ghostwhite;"> Of small, slender build and with a youthful, feminine visage, 
        Himura Kenshin cuts quite a different figure than would be expected
        of the legendary Hitokiri Battōsai and his appearance belies his twenty-eight years of age,
        making him look roughly ten years younger, but he is easily recognized by his 
        infamous distinguishing features: mid-back length red hair tied in a thick ponytail and a cross-shaped sword scar on his left cheek.
        Kenshin's hair is thick and abundant, with all of the shorter frontal hairs falling across his face as bangs rather than being in the ponytail at the nape of his neck. During the revolution, Kenshin wore his ponytail higher and at the end of the series, he has cut the ponytail
        entirely and wears his hair evenly at about chin length. Kenshin's eyes, too, are unusual, being a deep violet.
        In the anime series, when Kenshin's eyes change to reflect his psychological reversion to Hitokiri Battōsai, their color shifts from violet to gold

        The Legendary Scar
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">
    </h2>
</div>
    <p style="color: ghostwhite;">
        Kenshin's cross-shaped scar actually consists of two separate scars - a long one running diagonally down his face from just below the outer corner of his left eye
        to just above his chin and a slightly shorter scar running diagonally across it in the other direction from just to the left of the bridge of his nose to his left jawbone.
        In a redesign for the kanzenban, Kenshin's scar has been altered so that the lateral scar is longer, stretching across his nose to just below the inner corner of his right eye.

        Abilities
        </h2>
    </div>
    <p style="color: ghostwhite;">
        Kenshin, in keeping with his soft appearance, appears to be quite skilled at domestic 
        work as many of the Kamiya dojo residents comment favorably on his cooking and he is 
        frequently seen performing such tasks as grocery shopping, floor and shoji door cleaning and laundry.
        While he does all of these things diligently and eagerly,
        it appears that his taste for them is an acquired one
        which he displays only to strangers and new acquaintances, as he was
        loath to perform even the simplest chore on Hiko Seijūrō's orders. 
        However, it has also been shown that Kenshin's handwriting is not very good (with several 
        characters comparing it unfavorably to that of Watsuki's).
        Kenshin is also an unparalleled orator, capable of spinning eloquence or humor into an offhand comment and prone to making grand,
        moving speeches off the top of his head. While maintaining his cool, he is rather adept at philosophical arguments, swiftly seeing the
        cracks in any opponent's logic without missing a beat in conversation.    
        Kenshin is perhaps most well known for his almost inhuman swordsmanship. Having inherited the Hiten Mitsurugi-ryū sword style from his master,
        Hiko Seijūrō XIII, Kenshin's light frame allows him to use the style's "godspeed" to its fullest, moving so rapidly that he routinely outpaces
        the human eye, and his own prowess with Battōjutsu earned him his infamous moniker.
        Outside of Hiten Mitsurugi-ryū, Kenshin has displayed independent sword techniques which are indicative of his own acquired skills:
